# This function does an OS version check, to make sure it is using the correct method 
# with the launchctl tool for the OS in question.
#
# For Macs running OS X 10.9.x and earlier, the launchctl's bsexec function was used for this purpose. 
# bsexec allows you to start a process like a tool, script or application in a specific context. 
# One way to get the correct context for the logged-in user is to identify the process identifier (PID) 
# for the loginwindow process associated with the logged-in user.
#
# For Macs running OS X 10.10.x and later, launchctl's asuser function was used for this purpose. 
# The asuser function is designed to take the place of the bsexec function, in the context of 
# starting processes in the context of a specific user account. This makes it easier, as you now 
# just need to figure out the username and do not have to figure out the PID of the userâ€™s loginwindow process.
