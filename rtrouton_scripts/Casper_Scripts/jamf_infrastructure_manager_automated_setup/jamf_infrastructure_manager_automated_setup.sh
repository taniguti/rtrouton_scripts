#!/bin/bash

# This script is designed to install a Jamf Infrastructure Manager (JIM)
# on the following OSs:
#
# CentOS 7.x
# Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x
#
# Following installation, the JIM is enrolled with a specified Jamf Pro 
# server, using credentials provided in the script.

# Set Jamf Pro URL, username and password for the JIM enrollment process

jamfProURL="https://jamf.pro.server.here:8443"
jamfProUsername="jamf_pro_account_username_goes_here"
jamfProPassword="jamf_pro_account_password_goes_here"

# Set the Jamf Infrastructure Manager hostname for the JIM enrollment process
# This should be the external hostname which the Jamf Pro server will be 
# connecting to the JIM through. For example, if you have a load balancer sitting
# in front of the JIM, the load balancer is going to be the JIM's hostname.
#
# Note: The hostname of the machine must resolve both for the machine 
# hosting the JIM and for the remote Jamf Pro server, so there canâ€™t be 
# mismatches like having the JIM server itself think its hostname is 
# blahblah.int.company.com and the remote Jamf Pro server think the JIM's
# hostname is blehbleh.ext.company.com.
# 
# If necessary, set an entry into the /etc/hosts file on your 
# JIM server similar to what's shown below so that your JIM server's
# IP address maps to the hostname you're using for the JIM's hostname.
#
# ip.address.goes.here    blehbleh.ext.company.com

jimHostname="jim_hostname_goes_here"

# If the JIM hostname, Jamf Pro URL, the account username or the account password aren't available
# otherwise, you will be prompted to enter the requested hostname, URL or account credentials.
