This Casper Extension Attribute detects if a Mac's Java JDK was supplied by Apple or Oracle. If no Java JDK is detected as being installed, a "No Java JDK Available" message is displayed.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
