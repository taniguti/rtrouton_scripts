This Casper Extension Attribute detects if a Mac's Java browser plug-in in /Library/Internet Plug-Ins was supplied by Apple or Oracle. If no Java plug-in is detected, a "No Java Plug-In Available" message is displayed.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
