This Casper Extension Attribute is designed to identify whether or not a specific 802.11x wireless network is available on a Mac by checking the preferred wireless list and if the root CA for the 802.11x network is stored in /Library/Keychains/System.keychain

If both the wireless network and root CA are available, the script returns "Yes"
If both are not available, the script returns "No"

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
