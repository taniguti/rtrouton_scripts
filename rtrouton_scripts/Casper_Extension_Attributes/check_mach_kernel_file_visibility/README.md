This Extension Attribute checks to see if the **/mach_kernel** file is visible. The **/mach_kernel** file should be not visible when viewed from the Finder.

The Extension Attribute will display the following results:

If the **/mach_kernel** file exists and is not hidden - **Visible**

If the **/mach_kernel** file exists and is hidden - **Hidden**

If the **/mach_kernel** file does not exist - **/mach_kernel not present on OS X xx.xx.xx**


See **Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png** for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
