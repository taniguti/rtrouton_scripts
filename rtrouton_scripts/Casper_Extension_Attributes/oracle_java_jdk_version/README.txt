This Casper Extension Attribute detects if a Mac's Java JDK was supplied by Oracle. If Oracle's Java JDK is not detected as being installed, an "Oracle Java JDK Not Available" message is displayed.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
