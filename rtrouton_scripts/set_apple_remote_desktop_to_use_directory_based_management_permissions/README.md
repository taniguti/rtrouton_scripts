This script is designed to configure Apple Remote Desktop (ARD)'s management agent to work with directory-based logins. It is designed to be configured with a username and ARD management group, which is then used to configure ARD to use the membership of specific local directories to manage ARD's access permissions.

How the script works:

1. The script verifies that the specified username exists on the Mac.
2. Creates all four ARD permissions management groups.
3. Adds the specified user account to the specified management group.
4. Turns on ARD's management agent and configures it to use ARD's directory-based management to assign permissions.
